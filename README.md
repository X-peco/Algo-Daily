🌟 **Algorithm Learning Journey | 算法学习之旅** 🌟

> *"Keep pushing forward and being motivated!!!"*

🇬🇧 **English Version**  
**I started my algorithm-learning journey last month. To be honest, it was quite a struggle to make that decision at the time, since I was still unsure about my future path. Also, mastering algorithms isn't a simple thing, especially for a beginner like me.**

**Why do I say that? Because when I first started learning algorithms and tried to solve relevant LeetCode problems, it often happened that I would spend an entire afternoon without being able to solve one!**

**Fortunately, I adapted to this new way of algorithmic thinking very fast, and I have to admit that I'm now starting to enjoy this feeling when I immerse myself in finding possible solutions.**

Here, I'll share:
- 📚 Problems I encounter
- 💡 Solution approaches and thought processes
- 🚀 Lessons learned along the way

**If you spot any errors or have suggestions, please don't hesitate to let me know! Let's grow together.**

🇨🇳 **中文版本**  
**我刚刚上个月才开始我的算法学习之旅，说真的，做出这个决定对我蛮困难的，当时的我还没有明确我的之后的学习方案有哪些，而且掌握新的算法并不简单，尤其是对我这种初学者来说。**

**之所以这么说，是因为我刚开始接触算法并尝试做leetcode上相关算法的题目时，实际情况可能是我花了一个下午甚至还做不出来。**

**但好在我很快适应了这种算法思维，甚至开始有点享受探寻可行解法的过程了。**

这里我将分享：
- 📚 遇到的题目
- 💡 解题思路与思考过程
- 🚀 学习过程中的收获

**如发现任何错误或建议，请一定告诉我！让我们共同进步。**
