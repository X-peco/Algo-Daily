🌟 **Algorithm Learning Journey | 算法学习之旅** 🌟

> *"The most effective way to learn is by doing; the only way to build something amazing is piece by piece."*

🇬🇧 **English Version**  
Last month marked the beginning of my algorithm-learning adventure. Truthfully, making this commitment was challenging at the time, as I was still exploring different paths for my growth. Mastering algorithms is no simple feat, especially for a beginner like myself.  

Why do I say that? During my initial attempts at solving LeetCode problems, there were days I'd spend an entire afternoon grappling with a single challenge!  

Yet through persistence, I've grown to adapt to algorithmic thinking - and I must confess, I'm starting to love that moment of clarity when a solution clicks into place.  

Here, I'll share:
- 📚 Problems I encounter
- 💡 Solution approaches and thought processes
- 🚀 Lessons learned along the way

**If you spot any errors or have suggestions, please don't hesitate to let me know! Let's grow together.**

刚刚过去的这个月，我开启了算法学习之旅。坦诚地说，当时做出这个决定并不容易，我还在探索自己未来的成长方向。掌握算法绝非易事，尤其对我这样的初学者而言。

为什么这么说？最初尝试解LeetCode题目时，常常花整个下午连一道题都解不出来！

但坚持至今，我已逐渐适应算法思维——甚至开始享受解题过程，当思路豁然开朗的那一刻。

这里我将分享：
- 📚 遇到的题目
- 💡 解题思路与思考过程
- 🚀 学习过程中的收获

**如发现任何错误或建议，请一定告诉我！让我们共同进步。**
